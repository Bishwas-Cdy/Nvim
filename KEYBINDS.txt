If process still running:
  1. Open another terminal (outside nvim)

Tip: Some servers may fork/detach and need manual kill. Always check with ps aux if unsure.

How to create a file in a nested subdirectory
----------------------------------------------
In Neovim:
  :e B/b/c/newfile.txt   # Opens/creates file if folders exist
If folders do NOT exist:
  Open terminal (<leader>tt) and run:
    mkdir -p B/b/c && touch B/b/c/newfile.txt
  Then in Neovim:
    :e B/b/c/newfile.txt

Tip: Use `mkdir -p` to create all parent folders at once.

How to create folders and files using Neo-tree (no terminal needed)
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Open Neo-tree: <leader>e or <C-n>
2. Navigate to parent folder
3. Press 'a' to add
   - To create folder: type 'b/c/' and press Enter
   - To create file: type 'b/c/newfile.txt' and press Enter

Tip: You can create nested folders and files in one step using Neo-tree's 'a' (add) command.
